# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via an [issue](https://github.com/keylime/keylime/issues) or email to the [keylime mailing list](https://groups.io/g/keylime).

## Pull Request Process

1. Create an [issue](https://github.com/keylime/keylime/issues)
   outlining the fix or feature.
2. Fork the keylime repository to your own github account and clone it locally.
3. Hack on your changes.
4. Update the README.md or documentation in [keylime-docs](https://github.com/keylime/keylime-docs)
   with details of changes to any interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, CLI parameters and
   new or changed configuration values.
5. Correctly format your commit message see [Commit Messages](#Commit Message Guidelines)
   below.
6. Ensure that CI passes, if it fails, fix the failures.
7. Every pull request requires a review from the [core keylime team](https://github.com/orgs/keylime/teams/core)
   before merging.
8. If your pull request consists of more than one commit, please squash your
   commits as decribed in [Squash Commits](#Squash Commits)

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the commit formatting recommendations found on [Chris Beams' How to Write a Git Commit Message article]((https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Well formed commit messages not only help reviewers understand the nature of
the Pull Request, but also assists the release process where commit messages
are used to generate release notes.

A good example of a commit message would be as follows:

```
Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
change? Here's the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
like this:

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789
```

Note the `Resolves #123` tag, this references the issue raised and allows us to
ensure issues are associated and closed when a pull request is merged.

Please refer to [the github help page on message types](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)
for a complete list of issue references.

## Squash Commits

Should your pull request consist of more than one commit (perhaps due to
a change being requested during the review cycle), please perform a git squash
once a reviewer has approved your pull request.

A squash can be performed as follows. Let's say you have the following commits:

    initial commit
    second commit
    final commit

Run the command below with the number set to the total commits you wish to
squash (in our case 3 commits):

    git rebase -i HEAD~3

You default text editor will then open up and you will see the following::

    pick eb36612 initial commit
    pick 9ac8968 second commit
    pick a760569 final commit

    # Rebase eb1429f..a760569 onto eb1429f (3 commands)

We want to rebase on top of our first commit, so we change the other two commits
to `squash`:

    pick eb36612 initial commit
    squash 9ac8968 second commit
    squash a760569 final commit

After this, should you wish to update your commit message to better summarise
all of your pull request, run:

    git commit --amend

You will then need to force push (assuming your initial commit(s) were posted
to github):

    git push origin your-branch --force

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at <core@keylime.groups.io>. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
