This set of scripts will set up systemd to run the IBM TPM emulator and a stub to keep IMA updates in sync with the TPM emulator on startup.  

You can install it with:
`installer.sh` 

This assumes that tpm4720 and keylime are both already installed.  It will use some of the scripts installed/built by those tools.
